This is a helper file that will help us understand the codebase of the project. This is being dynamically updated by Tanvi.

HOW TO RUN THE APP
1. Clone the master version of the repository by "git clone https://github.com/tanviroy/ap-project1.git"
2. Then enter "npm install" to install dependencies
3. Open the entire project in an IDE (VSCode is great). Open a terminal and in the root directory (/ap-project1) run "npm start" to start the backend server.
4. Open another terminal in the frontend directory (/frontend) and run "npm start" to start React.

CODEBASE
/BACKEND 
/data.js: This is the master file of all product data. Products are stored as objects. Products are currently being served from this file but will shift to a database later.
/server.js: This is the entry point for the backend (aka the index.js file). All backend dependencies are connected here. Mongoose is connected, RESTful routes to be defined.
/passportConfig.js: This is where authentication strategies for passport js are confugured. Currently, only supports local authentication, O-Auth to be added.
/user.js: This is a Mongoose schema for a user. Currently only has username and password


/FRONTEND
/public: (Do not remove any of the default files in this directory.)

/src:
/Pages/Home.js: This is the Home Page - main page, will show all products here
/Pages/Cart.js: This is the Cart Page - will show products (if any) that are in the cart
/Pages/Login.js: This is the Login Page - user can login through email ID or Google OAuth. Currently supports local authentication, and login/ register/ getUser functions.
/App.js: This is the main file containing the core of the application. It holds major routes and renders components. 
/App.css: This is the main CSS file. Linked to App.js
/index.css: This is the main .css file containing *all* the styling for the elements of each page. 
/index.js: This is the starter file, containing React and the application essentially. Do NOT mess with this file!
