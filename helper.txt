This is a helper file that will help us understand the codebase of the project. This is being dynamically updated by Tanvi.

HOW TO RUN THE APP
1. Clone the master branch of the repository by "git clone https://github.com/tanviroy/ap-project1.git"
2. Then enter "npm install" in the root directory (/ap-project1) and in the frontend directory (/ap-project1/frontend) to install all dependencies
3. Open the entire project in an IDE (VSCode is great). Open a terminal and in the root directory (/ap-project1) run "npm start" to start the backend server.
4. Open another terminal in the frontend directory (/frontend) and run "npm start" to start React.

CODEBASE
/BACKEND 
/data.js: This is the master file of all product data. Products are stored as objects. Data from here served to API http://localhost:4000/api/products. Products are currently being served from this file but will shift to a database later.
/passportConfig.js: This is where authentication strategies for passport js are confugured. Currently, only supports local authentication, O-Auth to be added.
/server.js: This is the entry point for the backend (aka the index.js file). All backend dependencies are connected here. Mongoose is connected, RESTful routes defined. 
/user.js: This is a Mongoose schema (model) for a user. Currently only has username and password

/FRONTEND
/public: (Do not remove any of the default files in this directory.)

/App.js: This is the main file containing the core of the application. It holds major routes and renders pages (Home, Cart, SignUp, Profile) as components. 
/App.css: This is the main CSS file that we will add to. Linked to App.js
/index.css: This is the wrapper CSS file and can override App.css. We don't need to add to this.
